# Yumi's Cells Fan Translation
Translation by: Kense

## Forward
I'm a big fan of the Korean Webtoon "Yumi's Cells" by Lee Dong-geon, and it's one of the reasons I started learning Korean!
I originally read Yumi's Cells on the English Webtoon app before realizing that the original Korean one updates quicker, so I started reading there to get ahead.
I figured that since I am doing translation for practice anyways, I might as well as publish for others who might want to read!

## Disclaimer
I'm obviously not a native Korean, so my translations aren't perfect. If you have any suggestions for my translations, or notice a big error, please feel free to email me at kensening@gmail.com with your suggest/correction! I would really appreciate it!
