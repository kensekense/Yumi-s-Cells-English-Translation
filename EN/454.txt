It's okay! You need to calm down Yumi!!
Be cool! Play it cool!
//Tap tap!! Tap tap!!
Ah! I totally misread the situation
//Tap tap!! Tap tap!!
//Beep!
Okay haha, Have fun~ See you after break
... So pitiful
Yah!! You caused this don't just run away!!!
[-Logic Cell-] [-Emotion Cell-]
Step step
//Ah! Why did I send that message....
They're not even that close and you suggested they go see a movie together, who's gonna say yes to that!!!
That's right! Who would agree to that?!
We've been wearing whatever clothes and leaving the house!
[-Blabbering Cell-]
This bastard!! You talking smack?
//Grab
[-Fashion Cell-]
We've been pretty lowkey, should we try full makeup tomorrow?
//We'll rival the likes of Kyung Lim (t/n: Kyung Lim is a character from a webtoon about a makeover?) Hmm?!
//Boom!!!!
We have work to do, there's no use for full make up. Just put something normal on.
Is work important right now?!!
//Bzzzt!!
//Ah hothot!!
Assistant Manager Shin's on vacation, what's the point of putting on make up?
Stop fighting!
To compromise, we'll go with a naturally beautiful look
[And so the natural beauty looks completely out of place]
Ah, Ruby, you're already here?
What?! Are you going somewhere today??
.......
What do you mean? I'm wearing what I usually wear?
Those aren't your normal clothes though?
Everything else is in the wash, there was nothing else to wear
And you put make up on?
It's probably just my sunscreen?
Yumi... are you interested in Assistant Manager Shin by any chance?
?!!!!!
But he's not your style
Ah... not this again...
//just don't say anything...
Huh?! Assitant Manager Shin?! Aren't you on vacation?!
?!!!!!!
//Thump thump!!!!
People in love always get caught by this trick
//woosh
Ah!!!
I've been around you for long enough to know, he's totally not your style
//he seems super unfriendly
You're wrong, I'm not interested in him at all
I'm super experienced with love, that's why I'm telling you!
Meeting guys like Assistant Manager Shin will only give you grief!
//It's not like that
He gives off a super cold vibe!!!
No he doesn't!!! He's totally cute without his glasses!!!!
//Gasp!!
Ah... I accidentally said that out loud huh? What's with her expression?
//Why does it suddenly feel cold?
Excuse me
?!!
A... Assistant Manager Shin??
//Excuse me
Wh... why is he here..... Isn't he on break, why is he here?? Why??
//Hello Yumi
//Thump thump! Thump thump! Thump thump! Thump thump!
Maybe he felt bad about rejecting us so he came here!!!
[-Jinx Cell-]
[-Love Cell-]
I'm suddenly so happy!!!
What if he heard what I said about him looking cute without glasses?!
[-Anxiety Cell-]
There are lots of people who look cute without glasses
//Just play it off!
Having a serious look in this situation is highly suspicious!
[-Logic Cell-]
In this situation we have to hide our feelings with a cheery smile!
//Tada!!
[-Reaction 1-]
Plus, Yumi's looking super good! We've got the confidence!!
Oh?! Assistant Manager Shin! You're in the middle of break, did something come up?
The book the publisher was working on last month is out.... I forgot to tell you about it
You could have let me know after your break...
There's also stuff I wanted to talk to you about
?!
