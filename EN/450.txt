??!!!!
Hm? Isn't that Yumi?
Yea, it's Yumi
Should I say hi? Or something?
Nah... I'm getting off anyways
Plus, I don't wanna talk about work during my vacation
<<Yumi's Cell>> <<By: Lee Dong-geon>>
??!!
Hmm?! She got off here?
-Footsteps-
But she didn't get off here last week?
Is she meeting someone nearby?
Should I say hi now?
Nah, if I went to say hi I'd have to walk faster, forget it.
Let's keep our current pace
and keep a good distance from her
If running into her is such a bother, why not go another way?
[-Logic Cell-]
[-Hunger Cell-]
No! If we want to get Bungeo-ppang we have to go this way! (t/n: Bungeo-ppang is a type of bread pastry usually stuffed with a sweet red-bean paste and in the shape of a fish)
Ah...
It's Yumi again...
I guess she came to buy Bungeo-ppang too?
[The little bakery spot that only I know about is getting a lot of buzz]
But most people don't know about the secret best item on the menu, The strawberry-custard Bungeo-ppang
//Only I know about it
I'll take 10 strawberry-custard Bungeo-ppang!
Sorry, but we're out of ingrediants. The 8 left is all we have.
What?!!
Then I'll take all of them
All of them?!!
Not only 3 or 4?!!
But then... what about me!!!
Oh?! Hello
???? ???? ... Are you talking to me?
Check again!! We really don't know this person?!
They're not in the catalogue?
Who is this?
Shit!! Maybe it's someone trying to get our number?!!!
[-Jinx Cell-]
This is crazy!!!! He's asking for her number!!!
What's going on?!!!
I'll start the emergency scan right now!
[-First Impression Cell-]
OMG! It's like starring in a drama...
[-Writer Cell (Prime)-]
This moment... To think Yumi would get to experience it.
Attention everyone!!! The first impression is out!!!
Tell us already, hurry!
This man!!!
Our first impression is!
It's me, Assistant Manager Shin.
?!!!
Assistant Manager... Shin??
Ah... I didn't recognize you without your glasses. Hello.
//Hi
What are you doing here?
I came to get Bungeo-ppang.
