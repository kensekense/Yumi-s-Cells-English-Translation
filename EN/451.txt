<<Yumi's Cells>> <<By: Lee Dong-geon>>
Strawberry custard Bungeo-ppang? (t/n: Bungeo-ppang is a type of bread pastry usually filled with a sweet red-bean paste and in the shape of a fish)
But I bought all of them?
That's why they call me the Hunger cell!! 위너 테이킷 올!
[-Hunger Cell-]
What are you gonna do, eat it all alone like a pig?!!!
//Share!!! //Kick!
[-Giving Tree-]
!!!
Man, what to do? I bought all the ones they had left!!
Ah! I bought 8, you can take 4 of them.
Sorry, but can you wrap these 4 up separately?
Sorry for the trouble
//Bungeo-ppang record: 13
It's nothing, I wouldn't have been able to eat them all myself anyways.
Yah! Yah! Someone say something to Assistant Manager Shin!
[-Detective Cell-]
He's reaching for his wallet!
No don't worry about it!!! You don't have to pay me!!!
//Just take it! Take it!
//Hesitates!
... ...
He was reaching for his phone!!! Ah! Ugh I'm gonna die of embarrassment!!!
//Guess I'll pay for them haha
I'll get some icecream. Having Bungeo-ppang with icecream is the best!
Okay! Sounds good
What did you say the first impression was?
[-Curiosity Cell-]
He's <Nothing Special>! Stop prying!
//바닐라 두 개 포장해주세요
...
어색하네 뭐 할 말 없나? Like a funny joke or something
I got something! I have lots of questions!
[-Curiosity Cell-]
!!
[Curiosity Cell Q. Do you usually not wear glasses?]
My eyesight's not bad. It's because when I'm staring at the screen at work it hurts my eyes.
[Curiosity Cell Q. You permed your hair right?]
No, my hair's naturally curly. I get that a lot though.
[Hunger Cell Q. What's in the bag?]
Tonight's dinner. I bought some takeout mushroom kalguksu (t/n: Kalguksu is a Korean noodle dish made with fresh cut noodles)
Let's stop here with the questions. If I'm the only one asking questions, I'll seem aggressive.
//But there are more things I'm curious about...
We got a question guys!
Assistant Manager Shin asked us a question!!
What did he say!!! I didn't hear him!
Hmm?
Do you live nearby, Yumi?
What's this? Maybe...
If we're going the same way we can talk some more?!
Give it to me straight! Assistant Manager Shin's first impression was <Nothing Special> right?
[-Detective Cell-]
That... That's what I said! Why do you ask?
Assistant Manager Shin's trying to walk home with us to talk more!!
The first impression was <Nothing Special> but...
There's obviously more things to talk about!
It's just getting to know a fellow coworker!
Do I live close by? Yea... Why?
드라이아이스는 둘 다 30분짜리로 부탁합니다!
No problem!
This bastard can't get anything right!!!
... people can be wrong sometimes too
?!!
Oh?! This is the first impression of Assistant Manager Shin!!
In regards to the first impression: Heart-throb
That freaking liar Writer Cell! Yumi was flustered just then!!!
//Sizzle!
What... is this feeling
//Thump thump
