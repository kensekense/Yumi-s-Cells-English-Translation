//grab!
I underestimated her... Yumi's so experienced she was even able to use such a tactic...
That was the perfect time to use <XX>! (t/n: I have no idea what the translation was for the tactic)
//흥해요!!!
//pang!!
<흥해요> A tactic you use to offer some tissues, like you're taking care of a kid
Going from offering warm water right into the tissues!
//Rapidly scoring points
//Take this!
Here you go.
//slide-
Yumi! What are you doing?
Why did you use that tactic so coldly?!!
//Thump!
//You need to use it more nicely!
You won't score any points being a tsundere*!!
*Tsundere: where your moves go unnoticed (t/n: this is a translation of the memo, though not quite an accurate description of a tsundere)
Besides, Assistant Manager Shin's hurting struggling right now!
//Huff... Huff...
He's twice as likely to be receptive! This is a chance to score twice as many points!
So should we confirm the changes to the manuscript?
This is sad. Are you over him?
Hold up!! What is this?!!
//ta da!
It... it's an orange!!!!
OH my god!!!
She was setting up for a big move!!!
//An orange at a time like this!!!
Watch the ace!
<Oranges are good for when you're sick> A tactic where you tell the person who is sick that eating oranges will make them better.
If you're able to pull off this move with the orange
//pang!!!
//Thump!
You don't need points. The game instantly ends.
This is a good chance...
//roll roll
Yumi what are you doing?
Orange?
//slide
Why are you blowing away all these chances?
She can't be deliberately trying to draw a line between them can she?
Yumi
??
The orange....
It's pretty good
...Is that so
Deliberately drawing a line in a situation where you don't need to! Either she was rejected or she has no info on him!!
//It's one or the other!
If my prediction is right, Yumi has absolutely no info on him!
//Type type! Type!
You got to scout these things!
Hey Yunhee, do you know Daeyong's acquaintances well?
?!
//ring!!
lol why?
Do you know someone named Rudolph Shin?
Of course, he's Daeyong's best friend.
Does he have a girlfriend?
No, why?
...
?!!!!! Oh my god!
//BOOOHM!!
//Beep!
I'll be on my way
//Oh... you fool
Alright, take care
Do you not even know the basics of information gathering when you're interested in someone?
//You're not out of practice are you?
........
You've already failed in the scouting stage, Yumi
What do you want for lunch?
I already messaged Yunhee just now, I know everything!!!!
Rudolph! Kangaroo! Whatever his name is!
The editor in chief set him up....
On a blind date
//DOOM!!!!
