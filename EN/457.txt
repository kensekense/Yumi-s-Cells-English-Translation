[A love that returns no matter how you throw it away]
//Hey guys! Check it out!
Stop it!
This is the love we threw away isn't it? But isn't it a little bigger than before? 이거 봐
//함부로 버리지도 못하겠네...
//쑥~ 쑥~
사람 감정이 참 묘한 게 안될 걸 알면 포기하는 게 아니라 더 간절해지는 건 뭐지?
If we can't throw it away then we'll hide it!
Yumi won't know!
//....I... can hear you
[But hiding your feelings isn't worth it You need to have actions with your words]
/tap tap! Tap!
My break is over. I wanted to discuss some work with you, what time is good for you?
//Beep!
//Beep!
Any time is fine. Please feel free to stop by anytime.
[You see that? How formal I was?]
[This is a Yumi that won't even go near the line, let alone cross it]
[I'm not sulking!]
[From now on I'm only wearing comfortable clothes to work]
[It means that I'm not trying to look good for anyone]
[Assistant Manager Shin's pretty quick, but will he notice?]
Ooo, Yumi, rocking the business casual?
//Where'd you get that tracksuit?
Are you responsible for this?!
//Pah!!!
[-Fashion Cell-]
Hehe. You caught me.
It's because of cells like you that don't listen, I already had to throw makeup cell into prison.
//Yah! I've been waiting for you!
//Oh! You already here?
[But why are Yumi's lips a bit pink?]
//Because her lips are supple and healthy!
Healthy Cell that bastard... You put on some color lip balm didn't you...
These idiots! As long as that heart is still hidden in the town
You'll never be able to control the cells!
Don't you know what you have to do to come to your senses?
//?!!!!
Come to my senses?
Haven't you heard of a reality check??
[-Dislike Cell-]
Ah! You mean find something dislikeable!
[If Assistant Manager Shin does a bunch of stuff Yumi dislikes, then she'll come back to her senses!]
Crack!
//Ah! Disappointment!
//rub rub
[From now on I need to open up my senses and concentrate on him]
[And I need to find something that I dislike!]
Yumi! Assistant Manager Shin's here.
//shkshk
Mhmm okay
Sorry for being late.
A mask?? But the air quality's not bad today?
Huh? Maybe he got sick somewhere? It is flu season....
//Ahem! hem!
A sore throat??
Would you like some coffee?
No thank you. If I could just trouble you for some water.
