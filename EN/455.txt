You had something you wanted to talk about...?
It's about the movie we were talking about yesterday of course
Ah yea yea
Pay attention to the glasses!! Assistant Manager Shin only wears glasses when he reads!
[-Detective Cell-]
//Yea that's right!
It's so he can read the subtitles! He came here to take us to the movie!
Is he really here to ask Yumi to go watch the movie?!
So I've been giving it some thought. I think James King's movie has parts that feels like a romance novel.
The two both use curiosity to sustain a feeling of tension.
??
Surely enough, I didn't know who the culprit was just as I couldn't decipher the main lead's intention.
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Yesterday when we were talking about the movie I got the feeling you liked it. I think you can find a lot of ideas about suspense for your writing.
It's a long-winded way of saying that they should go see the movie together!
Does he really wanna go see the movie together?
When you put it like that, it makes me want to go see this movie right now
Yes, you should go see it, it was really well made
How could this be?! He already saw it!!
//Tonk!
[-Love Cell-] [-Detective Cell-]
...Did you already see it this morning?
Yea, I wanted to see before it left the theatres so,
That's it? Is that all we're asking?? Is that all he came here to say?
[-Doubtful Cell-]
I should get going, I don't want to get in the way of your work
Ah?? You're heading out?
//Clunk!
You... came here today to tell me that?
Yup
Both me and the publisher are really looking forward to your work
If we work hard I think it will come out really well
You're the _writer_ after all, my job as the _editor_ is to support you.
?!!!!!
Wait a second.... Was the conversation we just had really only just for work?
Is that what I'm really supposed to believe?? Am I just another coworker?
//Angry!!!
That's not it! It's just a way to make sure things aren't weird between us since we work together!
But did he really just come here today just to tell me that??
All we did was ask to go see a movie together! Ugh!
[-Love Cell-]
... Was our intention so obvious?
[-Writer Cell-]
I knew it!!!!!
What's the plan now?! If things are weird how are we gonna work together from now on?!
//Grab!
//Ow
Don't you know that all these moves are supposed to be vague?
?!
So that even in a dangerous situation like this, we can make a move!
[-Judgement Cell-]
Outside of things being a little awkward at work, there's no drawback!
//For Yumi!
Make a move!
I'll be going now
If you go with me, we'll be able to see the movie for free
//oh how shameful
??
I get a lot of vouchers for the movie theatre, so whenever you're feeling up to it
!!
We can watch the movie and we can talk about it
Let's take advantage of the vouchers
