Thanks for the Bungeo-ppang
Thank you too, enjoy your icecream
Have a good vacation
Take care
I was calm just a second ago
Is it happening again?
Fire!! I hate fire!!!
[-No No Cell-]
Big No No (t/d: It is a picture of Love Cell (Prime))
<<Yumi's Cell, By: Lee Dong-geon>>
Aren't you going to listen to your own words?
It's not good to be involved with someone from work!
Yumi doesn't need to get carried away emotionally over this
//Spray!!!
Eat your Bungeo-ppang
//Mmm...
... Just because I meet people, doesn't mean that they'll be interested in me.
//Crackle!!!
This type of thinking just proves you've already fallen for them! Stupid!
Holy!!!
Prime... Prime Love Cell?!!
[-Love Cell (Prime)-]
How did you get your powers back?!
You knew if you wanted to get with Assistant Manager Shin, you'll have to fight me first?!
[-Love Cell (Prime)-]
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
//Come at me!
//Boom!!
Heh, with pleasure! But wouldn't it nice if we could both just exist peacefully?
//Back then, we would've said the more the merrier
I'm using my lightning strike!
//Boom!!
Just the way I like it! But we worked really late yesterday, so we're tired today, please be considerate.
I'll use my never before seen legendary weapon!
//Cha!
God damn it!!! What's wrong with you, why are you using that on me!!
//Boom!!
//Ah hot!!
Okay I admit it, I like him
I... like Assistant Manager Shin
The One-Sided Crush starts now
Huh?! A crush??
Of course it's a crush, what did you expect? That you two were just gonna immediately be a thing?
Anyways, there's no way Assistant Manager Shin moves out from the friend-zone!
//Wait why?
The other has to <give you a chance>. That's the only way to get out!
He has to show he's interested. That's the only way out! 
//You don't even know this?
When you have a crush on someone and they flirt back, that's when it becomes a thing
//Crush + flirting -> a thing
If they don't show interest, a crush is the only thing it'll be
[Saving you a seat at the get-together]
//Here...
[Continuing to ask questions]
??
[Giving you a different smile than others]
These are the signs to show he's interested!
Did Assistant Manager Shin ever do these things?!
Nope!!!
That means he's not interested in Yumi
But
What if Yumi shows she's interested?
When showing interest to your crush,
The most effective method would be writing...
A text!
//The Love Manual
//Tap tap tap
Mmm...
//Send
The Icecream + Bungeo-ppang combo is realy good! +_+ Thanks for the icecream!
